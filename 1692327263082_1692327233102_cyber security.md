
## what is cyber crime?
- Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network.

- While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them.

- A primary effect of cybercrime is financial. Cybercrime can include many different types of profit—driven criminal activity, including ransomware attacks, email and internet Fraud, and identity fraud, as well as attempts to steal financial account, credit card or other payment card information.



## What is Information Security (InfoSec)?
- Information security (sometimes referred to as InfoSec) covers the tools and processes that organizations use to protect information.
- This includes policy settings that prevent unauthorized people From accessing business or personal information.
- Information security protects sensitive information from unauthorized activities, including inspection, modification, recording, and any disruption or destruction.
- The goal is to ensure the safety and privacy of critical data such as customer account details, financial data or intellectual property.

## What is E-Mail Spoofing?
- Email spoofing is a form of cyber attack in which a hacker sends an email that has been manipulated to seem as if it originated from a trusted source.<br>
- Email spoofing is a popular tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a known sender.<br>
- The goal of email spoofing is to trick recipients into opening or responding to the message.<br>
- Although most spoofed emails can be easily detected and can be remedied by simply deleting the message, some varieties can cause serious problems and pose security risks.<br>
- For example, a spoofed email may pretend to be  from a well-known shopping website, asking the recipient to provide sensitive data, such as password? or credit card number.<br>
- Alternatively, a spoofed email may include a link that installs malware on the user's device if clicked.<br>
- A common example of business email compromise (BEC) involves spoofing emails from the chief executive officer (CEO) or chief financial officer (CFO) of a company requesting a wire transfer or internal system access credentials.<br>


### Prevention

- Use spam filter — it automatically sorts spam emails into a specific folder.
- If you download an excel file that contains macros, turn macros off.
- Use an antivirus and anti malware software that alarms users if downloaded files are not safe.
- Do not open spam emails. They may tempt you to visit a Fraudulent link with “unbelievable offers.”   


## What is Cyber Defamation ?

- Defamation means giving an “injury to the reputation of a person” resulting from a statement which is false.
- If anyone damages someone’s reputation by the way of ‘Slander’ or ‘Libel’ one can sue for defamation.
- The term ‘Slander’ means “the crime of damaging someone’s reputation by false spoken statement”, while ‘Libel’ is an “false published or written statement by damaging someone’s reputation”.
- The term defamation is used in the section 499 of Indian Penal Code, 1869.
- Cyber defamation is also known as internet defamation or online defamation in the world of internet and its users.
- If any individual posts or publishes some false statement about the other individual through internet or emails the individual having the defamatory statement with the intention to defame the other about whom the statement has been made would amount to cyber defamation.
- Cyber defamation is among one of the most committed crime.
- Cyber crimes are neither bound by time nor by the boundaries which means person sitting in one corner can cause damage at any time the person sitting in another corner of the worldJ
- Cyber defamation is a new concept but the traditional definition of defamation is injury caused to the reputation of a person in the eyes of a third person, and this injury can be done by verbal or written communication or through signs and visible representations.

## Types of Defamation

 1) Libel — Any defamatory statement which is in written, printed, or picture form.
 2) Slander - Any Defamatory statement which is in a verbal form such as spoken words, gestures, or representation made with hands.



## What is Internet Time Theft?

- It refers to the theft in a manner where the unauthorized person uses internet hours paid by another person.
- The authorized person gets access to another person’s ISP user ID and password, either by hacking or by illegal means without that  person’s knowledge.
- Such a theft occurs when an unauthorized person uses the Internet hours paid for by another person.
- Basically, Internet time theft comes under hacking because the person who gets access to someone else's ISP user ID and password, either by hacking or by gaining access to it by illegal means, uses it tdf access the Internet without the other person's knowledge.
- However, one can identify time theft if the Internet time has to be recharged often,even when one's own use of the Internet is not frequent. The issue of Internet time theft is related to he_crime_conduct eg through "identity theft."  


## What is Hacking?

- Hacking in cyber security refers to the misuse of devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks to cause damage to or corrupt systems, gather information on users, steal data and documents, or disrupt data-related activity.
- A traditional view of hackers is a lone rogue programmer who is highly skilled in coding and modifying computer software and  systems. But this narrow view does not cover the true technical nature of hacking.
- Hacking is the act of identifying and then exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network, usually to gain unauthorized access to personal or organizational data. Hacking is not always a malicious activity, but the term has mostly negative connotations due to its association with cybercrime.
- Hacking is the activity of identifying weaknesses in a computer system or a network to exploit the security to gain access to personal data or business data. An example of computer hacking can be: using a password cracking algorithm to gain access to a computer system.

### Types of Hackers

 1) Ethical Hacker (White hat?
 2) Cracker (Black hat) 
 3) Grey hat 

## What is Spamming ?

- Spamming is the use electronic messaging systems like e-mails and other digital delivery systems and broadcast media to send unwanted bulk messages indiscriminately.
- The turn spamming is also applied to other media like Internet forums, Instant messaging, and mobile text
messaging, social networking spam, junk fax transmissions, television advertising and sharing network spam.
- Spam is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to a wholesale recipient list. Typically, spam is sent for commercial purposes.
- However, spam email can also contain a malicious attempt to gain access to your computer, so email security becomes an important defense.
- Spamming reFers to the act 0F bombarding users with emails about advertisements, offers, and promotions.
- About 85% of all emails are spam. or this 85K, 2% of the emails are deemed unsafe. These include phishing emails that steal personal data of users and contain attachments that download malware .

## Prevention

- Use span filter - it automatically sorts spam emails into a specific folder.
- If you download an excel file that contains macros, turn macros off .
- Use an antivirus and anti-malware software that alarms users if downloaded files are not safe.
- Do not open spam emails, They may tempt you to visit a fraudulent link with “unbelievable offers."


## What is Software Piracy?

- Software piracy can be defined as the use of software that is not properly licensed. That might include
copying, modifying, distributing of selling the software in ways that contravene copyright laws or license
terms.
- Software piracy is the act of stealing software that is legally protected. This stealing includes copying,
distributing, modifying or selling the software.

- Copyright laws were originally put into place so that the people who develop software (programmers, writers"
graphic artists, etc.) would get the proper credit and compensation for their work. when software piracy
occurs, compensation is stolen from these copyright holders.

- Software piracy is the illegal copying ,distributing ,sharing ,selling or use of software whether
intentional or not.

- Software piracy examples include activities such as an end—user installing a single-use license on multiple
computers, a holidaymaker  buying a pirated copy of a piece of software in the Far East or the mass distribution
of illegally obtained software.

## What is E-Mail Bombing/Mail Bombs

- A mail bomb is a form of a denial-oF-service (DoS) attack designed to overwhelm an inbox or inhibit a server by sending a massive number of emails to a specific person or system.

-  The aim is to fill up the recipient's disk space on the server or overload a server to stop it from functioning.

- Also known as email bombs and letter bombs, mail bombs inconvenience not only the intended target but veryone who uses the server.

- When a server is unresponsive, it can degrade network performance and potentially lead to downtime.

- An email bomb is a means to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on an email server.

- Email bombing occurs when threat actors send tons of emails to a specific inbox to overwhelm it and
its corresponding server. The result? The target’s inbox and server cease to Function.

- You can thus think of an email bomb as a DoS attack specific to email. Like a typical DoS attack, it can negatively affect a target organization’s operations. Stopping one of its email servers from working will halt communications inside and outside the network.   

## A network is often compromised for one of the followin three reasons:

1) Hacktivism: Hacktivism is the comblination of kWh activism. Intruders that wish to hack to
prove a political agenda or social cause are responsible.

2) Steal Money: This infiltration aims to steal money or data From the victim. Typically, the intent is to
abuse the other person For monetary advantage.

3) Spying: Spying is the entrance of a state-sponsored network in order to spy on an adversary or occasionally an ally. 


## what is Password Sniffing?

- A password sniffer is a software application that scans and records passwords that are used or broadcasted on a computer or network interface. It listens to all incoming and outgoing network traffic and records any instance of a data packet that contains a password.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by sniffing or capturing packets on the network, and then either sending them repeatedly to a victim machine or replaying them back to the sender with modifications.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by Sniffers are often used in system hacking as a tool for analyzing traffic patterns in a scenario where performing more intrusive and damaging attacks would not be desirable.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by Password Sniffing is a hacking technique that uses a special software application that allows a hacker to steal usernames and passwords simply by obsemassively recording network traffic.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by This often happens on public NiFi networks wh-“Q ’ * 9’ relatively easy to spy on weak or unencrypted traffic.

## What is Credit Card Frauds ? 

- Credit card fraud is a form of identity theft that involves an unauthorized taking of ‘another’s credit card information for the purpose of charging purchases to the account or removing funds from it.
  
- Credit card fraud schemes generally fall into one of two categories: application fraud and account takeover.

## Categories of Cybercrime

- There are three major categories that cybercrime falls into: individual, property and government.
The types» of methods used and difficulty  levels very depending on  the category.

## Property : 
- This is similar to a real-life instance of a criminal. illegally possessing an individual's bank
or credit card details. The hacker steals a person's hunk details to gain access to funds,make
purchases online or run phishing scars to got people to give away their information. They could also
use a malicious software to gain access to a web page with confidential information.

## Individual:

- This category of- cybercrime involves one individual distributing malicious or illegal information
online . This can  Include cybertalking, distributing pornography and trafficking.

## Government :

- This is the least common cybercrime, but is the most serious offense . A crime against the
government is also known as cyber terrorism. Government cybercrime includes hacking government 
websites,military websites or distributing propaganda. These criminals are usually terrorists or
enemy government of other nations.   



## How Criminals Plan to the Attacks :

1. Criminals use many methods and tools to locate the vulnerabilities of their target.
2. The target can be an individual and/or an organization.
3. Criminals plan passive and active attacks.
4. Active attacks are usually used to alter the system, whereas passive attacks attempt to gain information about the
target.
5. Active attacks may affect the availability, integrity and authenticity of data whereas passive attacks lead to
breaches of confidentiality.

## Reconnaissance

- The literal meaning of "Reconnaissance" is an act of reconnoitering- explore, often with the goal of finding something
or somebody (especially to gain information about an enemy or potent§al enemy).
- In the world of "hacking," reconnaissance phase begins with  " Footprinting "  this is the preparation toward
preattack phase, and involves accumulating data about the target's environment and computer architecture to find ways
to intrude into that environment.

- Footprinting gives an overview about system vulnerabilities and provides a judgment about possible exploitation of
those vulnerabilities. The objective of this preparatory phase is to understand the system, its networking ports and
services, and any other aspects of its security that are needful for launching the attack.

## Passive Attacks

- A passive attack involves gathering information about a target without his/her (individual's or company's) knowledge simple as watching a building to identify what time employees enter the building's premises. However, it is usual searches or by Googling (i,e., searching the required information with the help of search engine Google) an individual or company to gain information.

## Active Attacks

- An active attack involves probing the network to discover individual hosts to confirm the information (IP address type and version, and services on the network) gathered in the passive attack, phase. It involves the risk of detector and is called "Rattling the doorknobs" or "Active reconnaissance."

- Active reconnaissance can provide confirmation to an attacker about security measures in place,, but the process chance of being caught or raise suspicion.

## Scanning and Scrutinizing Gathered Information.

- Scanning is a key step to examine intelligently while gathering information about the target. 

## Attack (Gaining and Maintaining the System Access)

- After the scanning and enumeration, the attack is launched using the following steps:
 - Crack the password
   
Exploit he password
Execute the malicious command/applications;
Hide the files (if required);
Cover the tracks - delete the access logs, so that there is no trail illicit activity.  



## What is the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity and availability) ?

### The following is a breakdown of the three key concepts that form the CIA triad:

- Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to privacy. Confidentiality measures are designed to prevent sensitive information from unauthorized access attempts. It is common for data to be categorized according to the amount and type of damage that could be done if it fell into the wrong hands.More or less stringent measures can then be implemented according to those categories.

- Integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its lifecycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure data cannot altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality) .

- Availability means information should be consistently and readily accessible for authorized This involves properly maintaining hardware and technical infrastructure and systems that display the information.

## What is Authentication & non-repudiation

- Authenticity validates the source or origin of data and other file transfers through proof of identity. This is important because it ensures that the message (email, payment transaction, digital file, etc.) was not corrupted or intercepted during transmission. Through authentication processes,users can verify their identities by providing specific credentials.

- Non-repudiation is a procedural, legal concept that proves the legitimacy of a message or data transfer by providing undeniable evidence of both authenticity and integrity. To establish complete data integrity and that the data was not altered or forged in any way, there are a couple of methods to do so, including asymmetric cryptography and digital certificates.

## What is Information Security?

- Information security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks.
- It involves the protection of information systems and the information processed, stored and transmitted by these systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.
- This includes the protection of personal information, financial information, and sensitive or confidential information stored in both digital and physical forms.
- Effective information security requires a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach,involving people, processes, and technology.
- Information Security is not only about securing information from unauthorized access.
- Information Security is basically the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information.



## What are the security services of Information Security?

- Message Confidentiality — The principle of confidentiality defines that only the sender and the intended recipient should be capable to create the element of the message.

- Confidentiality can be used at several levels on the basis of content of an information to be transmitted.

- Connection Confidentiality — The protection of all user information on a connection.

- Connectionless Confidentiality — The security of all user data in an individual data block.

- Traffic-flow Confidentiality — The protection of the information that can be derived from observation of traffic flows.

- Authentication — The authentication service is concerned with likely that a connection is authentic.

- Non-repudiation — Nonrepudiation avoids either sender or receiver from adverse a transmitted message.

- Access Control - The principle of access control decides who should be capable to access information or system through communication link.

- Data Integrity — Data integrity is designed to secure information from modification, insertion, deletion and rehash entity.



## WHAT IS E-COMMERCE SECURITY
- E-commerce security is the protection of e-commerce assets from unauthorized access, use, alteratibn,or destruction.
- E-commerce security is a set of guidelines that ensures safe online transactions.
-> Just like physical stores invest in security guards or cameras to prevent theft, online stores need to defend against cyberattacks.
 I
## 6 dimensions of e-commerce security 
***********************
1. Integrity: prevention against unauthorized data modification 
2. Nonrepudiation: prevention against any one party from reneging on an agreement after the fact
3. Authenticity: authentication of data source 
4. Confidentiality: protection against unauthorized data disclosure 
5. Privacy: provision of data control and disclosure
6. Availability: prevention against data delays or removal


## What is Computer Forensics ? 

- Computer Forensics is scientific method of investigation and analysis in order to gether evidence from digital devices  or Computer networks and components which is suitable for presentation in a court of law or legal body.

- It involves performing a structural investigation while intaining a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computer and what was responsible for it.

### TYPES

- Disk forensics: It deals with extracting raw data from the primary or secondary storage of the device by searching active, modified, or deleted files .

- Netwrok Forensics : It is sub-branch of Computer Forensics that involves  monitoring and analyzing the computer network.

- Database Forensics: It deals with the study and examination of databases and their related metadata.

- Malware Forensics: It deal with the identication of suspicious code and studying  viruses, worms etc.

- Email Forensics: It deals with emails and their recovery and analysis, including deleted emails, calendars, and contacts.

- Memory Forensics : Deal with collecting data from (System registers,cache,RAM) in raw form and them analysing it for further investigation.

- Mobile Phone Forensics: It mainly deals with the examination and analysis of phones and smartphones and helps to retrieve contacts, call logs, Incoming, and outgoing sms, etc., and other data present in it.


## what is Steganography ?

- A steganography technique involves hiding sensitive information within an ordinaryJ non-secret file or message, so that it will not be detected.
- The sensitive information will then be extracted from the ordinary file or message at its destination, thus avoiding detection.
- Steganography is an additional step that can be used in conjunction with encryption in order to conceal or protect data.
- Steganography is a means of concealing secret information within (or even on top of) an otherwise mundane, non-secret document or other media to avoid detection.
- It comes from the Greek words steganos, which means "covered” or "hidden,“ and graph, which means " to write." Hence, "hidden writing."
- You can use steganography to hide text, video, images, or even audio data. It's a helpful bit of knowledge, limited only by the type of medium and the author's imagination.


## what is Cryptography ?

- Cryptography is technique of securing information and communications through use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it.

- Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix “crypt" means "hidden" and suffix "graphy" means ”writing".

- In Cryptography the techniques which are use to protect information are obtained from mathematical concepts and a set of rule based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode it.

- These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions.  


## what is system Integrity check?

- System integrity check is a function that runs the status revision of security detectors and devices before arming.
- The function prevents arming the system if the window in the room is not closed, the detector body open, or communication wiLh one of the devices is lost.

## What is antivirus software (antivirus program)? I
- Antivirus software (antivirus program) is a security program designed to prevent, detect, search an remove viruses and other types of malware from computers, networks and other devices.

- Often included as part of a security package, antivirus software can also be purchased as a standalone option.

- Typically installed on a computer as a proactive approach to cybersecurity, an antivirus program can help mitigate a variety of cyber threats, including keyloggers, browser hijackers, Trojan horses, worm
rootkits, spyware, adware, botnets, phishing attempts and ransomware attacks.


## what is operating system hardening ?

- It is type or system hardening. It involves patching and applying advanced system security procedures to sucure the server's os. Automatically installing updates, patches, and services packs are some of the most effective methods to harden the os.

- An OS hardening is  similar to application hardening in that the OS is a type of software. Operating system asr?enine provides basic software that grant  those applications access to specific activities on your server.

- operating system developer frequently perform a good job of issuing  os updates and encouraging users to install them on microsoft linux and ios. These frequent updates can help to keep your system secure and resilient to cyber attacks.

## what is  Operating system Security ?

- The process of ensuring us availability, confidentiality, integrity is know as Operating system security. OS security refer: to the process or measures taken In protect the Operating system from danger, Including viruses malware and remote hacker instructions Operating system security  comprises all preventive-control that protect any system  assets that could be stolen, modified or deleted it OS security is breached. 

- OS Security Vulnerabilities, updatus and patches.
- OS Integrity checks.
- Anti virus software.
- Design of secure OS and OS hardening.
- Configuring the OS for security (Technique).
