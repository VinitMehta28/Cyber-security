Cybercrime can include many different types of profit—driven criminal activity, including ransomware attacks, email and internet Fraud, and identity fraud, as well as attempts to steal financial account, credit card or other payment card information.



## What is Information Security (InfoSec)?
- Information security (sometimes referred to as InfoSec) covers the tools and processes that organizations use to protect information.
- This includes policy settings that prevent unauthorized people From accessing business or personal information.
- Information security protects sensitive information from unauthorized activities, including inspection, modification, recording, and any disruption or destruction.
- The goal is to ensure the safety and privacy of critical data such as customer account details, financial data or intellectual property.

## Principles of Information Security?

1) Confidentiality
2) Integrity
3) Availability

## What is E-Mail Spoofing?
- Email spoofing is a form of cyber attack in which a hacker sends an email that has been manipulated to seem as if it originated from a trusted source.<br>
- Email spoofing is a popular tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a known sender.<br>
- The goal of email spoofing is to trick recipients into opening or responding to the message.<br>
- Although most spoofed emails can be easily detected and can be remedied by simply deleting the message, some varieties can cause serious problems and pose security risks.<br>
- For example, a spoofed email may pretend to be  from a well-known shopping website, asking the recipient to provide sensitive data, such as password? or credit card number.<br>
- Alternatively, a spoofed email may include a link that installs malware on the user's device if clicked.<br>
- A common example of business email compromise (BEC) involves spoofing emails from the chief executive officer (CEO) or chief financial officer (CFO) of a company requesting a wire transfer or internal system access credentials.<br>


### Prevention

- Use spam filter — it automatically sorts spam emails into a specific folder.
- If you download an excel file that contains macros, turn macros off.
- Use an antivirus and anti malware software that alarms users if downloaded files are not safe.
- Do not open spam emails. They may tempt you to visit a Fraudulent link with “unbelievable offers.”   


## What is Cyber Defamation ?

- Defamation means giving an “injury to the reputation of a person” resulting from a statement which is false.
- If anyone damages someone’s reputation by the way of ‘Slander’ or ‘Libel’ one can sue for defamation.
- The term ‘Slander’ means “the crime of damaging someone’s reputation by false spoken statement”, while ‘Libel’ is an “false published or written statement by damaging someone’s reputation”.
- The term defamation is used in the section 499 of Indian Penal Code, 1869.
- Cyber defamation is also known as internet defamation or online defamation in the world of internet and its users.
- If any individual posts or publishes some false statement about the other individual through internet or emails the individual having the defamatory statement with the intention to defame the other about whom the statement has been made would amount to cyber defamation.
- Cyber defamation is among one of the most committed crime.
- Cyber crimes are neither bound by time nor by the boundaries which means person sitting in one corner can cause damage at any time the person sitting in another corner of the worldJ
- Cyber defamation is a new concept but the traditional definition of defamation is injury caused to the reputation of a person in the eyes of a third person, and this injury can be done by verbal or written communication or through signs and visible representations.

 2) Slander - Any Defamatory statement which is in a verbal form such as spoken words, gestures, or representation made with hands.



## What is Internet Time Theft?

- It refers to the theft in a manner where the unauthorized person uses internet hours paid by another person.
- The authorized person gets access to another person’s ISP user ID and password, either by hacking or by illegal means without that  person’s knowledge.
- Such a theft occurs when an unauthorized person uses the Internet hours paid for by another person.
- Basically, Internet time theft comes under hacking because the person who gets access to someone else's ISP user ID and password, either by hacking or by gaining access to it by illegal means, uses it tdf access the Internet without the other person's knowledge.
- However, one can identify time theft if the Internet time has to be recharged often,even when one's own use of the Internet is not frequent. The issue of Internet time theft is related to he_crime_conduct eg through "identity theft."  


## What is Hacking?

- Hacking in cyber security refers to the misuse of devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks to cause damage to or corrupt systems, gather information on users, steal data and documents, or disrupt data-related activity.
- A traditional view of hackers is a lone rogue programmer who is highly skilled in coding and modifying computer software and  systems. But this narrow view does not cover the true technical nature of hacking.
- Hacking is the act of identifying and then exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network, usually to gain unauthorized access to personal or organizational data. Hacking is not always a malicious activity, but the term has mostly negative connotations due to its association with cybercrime.
- Hacking is the activity of identifying weaknesses in a computer system or a network to exploit the security to gain access to personal data or business data. An example of computer hacking can be: using a password cracking algorithm to gain access to a computer system.

### Types of Hackers

 1) Ethical Hacker (White hat?
 2) Cracker (Black hat) 
 3) Grey hat 

## What is Spamming?

- Spamming is the use electronic messaging systems like e-mails and other digital delivery systems and broadcast media to send unwanted bulk messages indiscriminately.
- The turn spamming is also applied to other media like Internet forums, Instant messaging, and mobile text
messaging, social networking spam, junk fax transmissions, television advertising and sharing network spam.
- Spam is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to a wholesale recipient list. Typically, spam is sent for commercial purposes.
- However, spam email can also contain a malicious attempt to gain access to your computer, so email security becomes an important defense.
- Spamming reFers to the act 0F bombarding users with emails about advertisements, offers, and promotions.
- About 85% of all emails are spam. or this 85K, 2% of the emails are deemed unsafe. These include phishing emails that steal personal data of users and contain attachments that download malware .

### Prevention

- Use span filter - it automatically sorts spam emails into a specific folder.
- If you download an excel file that contains macros, turn macros off .
- Use an antivirus and anti-malware software that alarms users if downloaded files are not safe.
- Do not open spam emails, They may tempt you to visit a fraudulent link with “unbelievable offers."


## What is Software Piracy?

- Software piracy can be defined as the use of software that is not properly licensed. That might include
copying, modifying, distributing of selling the software in ways that contravene copyright laws or license
terms.
- Software piracy is the act of stealing software that is legally protected. This stealing includes copying,
distributing, modifying or selling the software.

- Copyright laws were originally put into place so that the people who develop software (programmers, writers"
graphic artists, etc.) would get the proper credit and compensation for their work. when software piracy
occurs, compensation is stolen from these copyright holders.

- Software piracy is the illegal copying ,distributing ,sharing ,selling or use of software whether
intentional or not.

- Software piracy examples include activities such as an end—user installing a single-use license on multiple
computers, a holidaymaker  buying a pirated copy of a piece of software in the Far East or the mass distribution
of illegally obtained software.

## What is E-Mail Bombing/Mail Bombs

- A mail bomb is a form of a denial-oF-service (DoS) attack designed to overwhelm an inbox or inhibit a server by sending a massive number of emails to a specific person or system.

-  The aim is to fill up the recipient's disk space on the server or overload a server to stop it from functioning.

- Also known as email bombs and letter bombs, mail bombs inconvenience not only the intended target but veryone who uses the server.

- When a server is unresponsive, it can degrade network performance and potentially lead to downtime.

- An email bomb is a means to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on an email server.

- Email bombing occurs when threat actors send tons of emails to a specific inbox to overwhelm it and
its corresponding server. The result? The target’s inbox and server cease to Function.

- You can thus think of an email bomb as a DoS attack specific to email. Like a typical DoS attack, it can negatively affect a target organization’s operations. Stopping one of its email servers from working will halt communications inside and outside the network.   

### A network is often compromised for one of the followin three reasons:

1) Hacktivism: Hacktivism is the comblination of kWh activism. Intruders that wish to hack to
prove a political agenda or social cause are responsible.

2) Steal Money: This infiltration aims to steal money or data From the victim. Typically, the intent is to
abuse the other person For monetary advantage.

3) Spying: Spying is the entrance of a state-sponsored network in order to spy on an adversary or occasionally an ally. 


## what is Password Sniffing?

- A password sniffer is a software application that scans and records passwords that are used or broadcasted on a computer or network interface. It listens to all incoming and outgoing network traffic and records any instance of a data packet that contains a password.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by sniffing or capturing packets on the network, and then either sending them repeatedly to a victim machine or replaying them back to the sender with modifications.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by Sniffers are often used in system hacking as a tool for analyzing traffic patterns in a scenario where performing more intrusive and damaging attacks would not be desirable.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by Password Sniffing is a hacking technique that uses a special software application that allows a hacker to steal usernames and passwords simply by obsemassively recording network traffic.

-  A sniffing attack in system hacking is a Form of denial-oF-service attack which is carried out by This often happens on public NiFi networks wh-“Q ’ * 9’ relatively easy to spy on weak or unencrypted traffic.
