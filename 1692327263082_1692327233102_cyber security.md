Categories of Cybecrime

There are three major categories that cybercrime falls into: individual, property and government.
The types» of methods used and difficulty  levels very depending on  the category.

Property : 
This is similar to a real-life instance of a criminal. illegally possessing an individual's bank
or credit card details. The hacker steals a person's hunk details to gain access to funds,make
purchases online or run phishing scars to got people to give away their information. They could also
use a malicious software to gain access to a web page with confidential information.

Individual:

This category of- cybercrime involves one individual distributing malicious or illegal information
online . This can  Include cybertalking, distributing pornography and trafficking.

Government :

This is the least common cybercrime, but is the most serious offense . A crime against the
government is also known as cyber terrorism. Government cybercrime includes hacking government 
websites,military websites or distributing propaganda. These criminals are usually terrorists or
enemy government of other nations.   



How Criminals Plan to the Attacks:
-> Criminals use many methods and tools to locate the vulnerabilities of their target.
-> The target can be an individual and/or an organization.
-> Criminals plan passive and active attacks.
-> Active attacks are usually used to alter the system, whereas passive attacks attempt to gain information about the
target.
-> Active attacks may affect the availability, integrity and authenticity of data whereas passive attacks lead to
breaches of confidentiality.

Reconnaissance
The literal meaning of "Reconnaissance" is an act of reconnoitering- explore, often with the goal of finding something
or somebody (especially to gain information about an enemy or potent§al enemy).
—> In the world of "hacking," reconnaissance phase begins with  " Footprinting "  this is the preparation toward
preattack phase, and involves accumulating data about the target's environment and computer architecture to find ways
to intrude into that environment.

-> Footprinting gives an overview about system vulnerabilities and provides a judgment about possible exploitation of
those vulnerabilities. The objective of this preparatory phase is to understand the system, its networking ports and
services, and any other aspects of its security that are needful for launching the attack.



Passive Attacks
---------------

A passive attack involves gathering information about a target without his/her (individual's or company's) knowle
simple as watching a building to identify what time employees enter the building's premises. However, it is usual
searches or by Googling (i,e., searching the required information with the help of search engine Google) an indiv
gain information.

Active Attacks
--------------

An active attack involves probing the network to discover individual hosts to confirm the information (IP address
type and version, and services on the network) gathered in the passive attack, phase. It involves the risk of detu
called "Rattling the doorknobs" or "Active reconnaissance."

Active reconnaissance can provide confirmation to an attacker about security measures in place,, but the process
chance of being caught or raise suspicion.

Scanning and Scrutinizing Gathered Information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scanning is a key step to examine intelligently while gathering information about the target. I

Attack (Gaining and Maintaining the System Access)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the scanning and enumeration, the attack is launched using the following steps:

Crack the password
Exploit he password
Execute the malicious command/applications;
Hide the files (if required);
Cover the tracks - delete the access logs, so that there is no trail illicit activity.
